            <p class="">The hand that rocks the cradle
                also makes the house a home.
                It is the prayers of the mother
                that keeps the family strong.
                <br>
                Mommy rises early in the morning
                and bathes her day in prayer.
                She talks to God about her family
                and places them in His care.    
                <br>
                Mommy communicates her love
                in a thousand different ways.
                When there's a need, she is there, 
                whether it is night or day. 
                <br>
                Mommy seasons life with love
                and gives so much of herself.
                God placed in her the best He had
                and made her unlike anyone else. 
                <br>
                When challenges come our way 
                and when trials block our view,
                Mother kneels down beside her bed
                and prays the family through.
                <br>
                I love you Mom and really appreciate you.
                For putting up with me over these 19 years.
